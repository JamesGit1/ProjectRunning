# ProjectRunning
All the setup is here - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/
But basically you need to install node.js and then run app.js in web-api-auth-examples-master\authorization_code

WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DON'T CHANGE SECRET KEY IN APP.JS WHICH I DONT WANT TO UPLOAD HERE

./myApp contains all app code for ionic/react/capacitor

https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/your-first-app/2-taking-photos , basic photo gallery implemented from this tutorial NOTE : CameraPhoto depreciated replaced by Photo, Photo requires additional filetype variable but apart from that exactly the same as in docs

# ProjectRunning
All the setup is here - https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/
But basically you need to install node.js and then run app.js in web-api-auth-examples-master\authorization_code

WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DON'T CHANGE SECRET KEY IN APP.JS WHICH I DONT WANT TO UPLOAD HERE

./myApp contains all app code for react/capacitor
